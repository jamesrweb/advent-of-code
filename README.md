# Advent of Code 2020

Advent of Code is an Advent calendar of programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like. People use them as a speed contest, interview prep, company training, university coursework, practice problems, or to challenge each other. Each puzzle has two parts to complete and each of these parts are eligible for 1 star. This means that a total of 50 stars are up for grabs as you work through each of the 25 the challenges.

## My Results

These are my contributions for the Advent of Code 2020 event with corresponding results for each challenge.

## My statistics for each days challenge

Below you will find some statistics regarding my contributions to the advent of code this year.

Some items worth nothing here:

-   The *Time* column represents how long the challenge solution was submitted after the challenge was originally posted.
-   The *Rank* column represents who completed the challenge the fastest compared to when the challenge was originally posted. The number left of the `/` is my ranking and the number right of the `/` is the total submissions given a rank for that days part. Please note that the number to the right of the `/` is correct as of the 30/12/2020 at 07:15am CET but will of course differ as time goes on and final submissions are entered over the new year period by stragglers like myself.
-   The *Score* column represents the points awarded for submitting the correct challenge solution and earning a star within the first 100 correct submissions. Getting a star first for each part in a challenge is worth 100 points, second is 99, and so on down to 1 point at 100th place.
