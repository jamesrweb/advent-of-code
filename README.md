# Advent of Code

Advent of Code is an Advent calendar of programming puzzles for a variety of
skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you
like. People use them as a speed contest, interview prep, company training,
university coursework, practice problems, or to challenge each other. Each
puzzle has two parts to complete and each of these parts are eligible for 1
star. This means that a total of 50 stars are up for grabs as you work through
each of the 25 the challenges.

Each subdirectory of this repository with a year as its name represents a set of
submissions for that year. Each year contains a `README.md` file with an
overview of each challenge, languages used and overall results. You can look
into the solutions submitted also should you desire to do so.
