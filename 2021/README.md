## My statistics for each days challenge

Below you will find some statistics regarding my contributions to the advent of
code this year.

Some items worth nothing here:

- The _Time_ column represents how long the challenge solution was submitted
  after the challenge was originally posted.
- The _Rank_ column represents who completed the challenge the fastest compared
  to when the challenge was originally posted, my position in these rankings are
  in this column.
- The _Score_ column represents the points awarded for submitting the correct
  challenge solution and earning a star within the first 100 correct
  submissions. Getting a star first for each part in a challenge is worth 100
  points, second is 99, and so on down to 1 point at 100th place.
