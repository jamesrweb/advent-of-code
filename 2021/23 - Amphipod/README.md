## Day 23 - Amphipod

Day 23 required no code since it could be solved manually. This being the case,
no code is committed for this day. Perhaps I will implement an algorithm for it
later since it is effectively just a variation the tower of hanoi problem that
can be solved relatively easily using A\* or Dijkstra since we deal with costs
and weighting of moves.
